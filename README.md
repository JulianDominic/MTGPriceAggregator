# MTG Price Aggregator

This script gathers the cheapest variant of the card requested.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed and added to `PATH`.
2. Dowload/Clone the repository or just `main.py`.
3. Download the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the script.

``` bash
python main.py
```

``` code
Name of card: <name-of-card>
```

Do note that `<name-of-card>` needs to have the correct spelling, and spelt exactly the same as the card. However, the case does not matter.

For example, to find `Chandra's Ignition`, it cannot be `Chandras Ignition`.
